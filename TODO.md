- config for shortcut to trigger the search HUD (change the shortcut)
- keyboard nav in search UI (up/down/enter to run)
- ergonomics in search (should autoselect first match, and run on enter)
- custom icon
- support background running of scripts (like setting up cron jobs basically, but in UI and conditionally like reminders maybe?)
- open watched foldrs in finder in watchedfoldersview
- browse discovered scripts
- _favorite_ discovered scripts to show in menu bar dropdown
- nicer menu bar context menu

- might be nice to unit test the core logic harder as it expands
